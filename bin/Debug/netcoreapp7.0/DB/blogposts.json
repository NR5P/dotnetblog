I will spend a lot of time repairing something that most people would throw away without a care. I'm like this for a number of reasons. </p><ul><li>I hate to see something go to a landfill that except for a small problem is perfectly usable. </li><li>When fixing the weak point of an item you make it better than factory, especially if you buy the same item, you are getting the same weak point. </li><li>When repairing something you have a chance to make it better, this kind of goes along with point 2, make it better and stronger than before.</li><li>It gives a learning opportunity, I wouldn't be where I am if I wasn't like this :). </li><li>I'm frugal</li></ul><p class='post-par'>Our dishwasher isn’t anything special, in fact I think it's about the cheapest model you can get. It was only a few months old and it was already rusting around the vent. It completely failed to operate one day, I was hoping it might have been a failed sensor or a switch. But after some trouble shooting determined it was the micro controller that failed. </p><p class='post-part'>A dishwasher is not really a very complex thing, it fills up with water, dispenses soap, washes, rinses, and drains. Most all of these controls use 120vac. Some might be a little more complex like having a temperature sensor to dispense soap at a certain temp but ours didn't even have this. After some research on dishwasher cycles, how they work, and the normal timings of dishwasher cycles I was on my way.</p><p class='post-par'>I have plenty of Arduino, Raspberry Pi and esp32 boards laying around. I also had a relay board. I decided to home brew my own micro controller unit, in this case I opted for an Arduino Mega 2560 knockoff. </p><p class='post-par'>Not only would I be able to repair the dishwasher but I was thinking there might be other features I could add on in the future. The only thing that took a moment to figure out, and was the most complicated part, was the divert-er valve. On ours there is a valve that rotates and diverts water to either the top section sprayer or bottom sprayer independentally. I imagine this is because of water pressure. It has a motor that physically rotates, and has a sensor that shorts when it's in the next position. So basically half way through the wash I initiate rotation(send power to the rotating motor) and check for a low resistance in on the sensor leads and stop rotation(stop power to the rotating motor) and continue the second half of wash (and the same thing for rinse)</p><p class='post-par'>For the soap dispenser I am dispensing at beginning of wash cycle. I have thought about playing with this and fine tuning. I see that some dishwashers perform this task when they reach a certain temperature. Our dishwasher doesn't have a real temperature sensor. It's basically a temperature on/off switch.</p><p class='post-par'>For water inlet I'm running this on a timer. There is an on/off switch that detects fill level which I'm running the power through (just like it worked originally). The Arduino fill valve stays on longer than required to fill to dishwasher level, the fill valve is stopped when the fill sensor triggers simply because power is cut to the fill valve. Should the Arduino fail and keep the drain on the drain switch will protect from overfilling. Should the overfill switch fail then the timer on the Arduino will protect from flooding.</p><p class='post-par'>Below is a summary of what I’m doing for additional modes.The wash motor runs on a timer.The drain motor runs on a timer.The heater (dryer) runs on a timer.For the vent pin I'm opening up during drying.</p><p class='post-par'>I have a display that simply prints the number of minutes remaining and the mode it’s in. It then prints out “Finished! :D” when complete.</p><p class='post-par'>I completed this project and the code is in the description. I 3d printed a panel for the display and we are still using the dishwasher today. The rust has gotten worse and the racks inside are deteriorating and my wife has been dropping hints about wanting a new one, so I feel the days are numbered for it. But my repair has had it working great, and cleaning dishes better than it did new. The reason it cleans better than new is because we were able to adjust wash and rinse times. I never really got around to adding additional features I wanted to, partly because it has worked fine and was unnecessary. </p>",
